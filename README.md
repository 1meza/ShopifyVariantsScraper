# ShopifyVariantScraper
Twitter: @MrSnowZ_21

Module code for a discord command that scrapes Shopify URL variants.

This command can be used in your Discord bot code to scrape Shopify URL variants. I created this with axios although GOT might be a better option.

My goal with this command was to seperate the sizes and variants, making it easier to copy and paste into your sneaker bot. Most variant scrapers are annoying to mass copy variants so I made my own, thanks @TAJ4K for helping me with this. To make it a even better we added the Size field for ShoePalace.com, which shows the stock for each size loaded in the product URL.

This code cannot be used by itself, you must add it onto existing code, if you already have command/event handlers then you can just add the file right in and no extra work should be needed.

Requirements (npm install): 
discord.js 
axios
